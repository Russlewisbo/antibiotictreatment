## Antibiotics: <br> Essential for practice of modern medicine {background-image="images/antibiotic-resistance.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

<br>

-   Enable complicated and deeply-invasive surgery

-   Aggressive chemotherapy for cancer

-   Fundemental aspects of critical care

    -   e.g., central venous catheters, mechanical ventilation

-   Care for premature infants

-   Solid organ and stem cell transplantation

-   **Antibiotics created a revolution in the practice of medicine, transforming a primarily diagnostic-focused field to a *therapeutic, interventional* profession**

## Antibiotics are a societal trust

<br> <br> - Antibiotic overprescription is a *tragedy of the commons*: individual undertakes an action that they perceive to be in their own self-interest but that causes harm to society at large - When such an action is undertaken rarely, the harm to society is not noticeable - When it happens tens of millions of times per year, as with inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions, the collective harm to society can be catastrophic - Given the power of antibiotics to save lives, and the constant erosion of that power through their use, one of the most important functions of the physician is to serve as an expert *in the use and protection of antimicrobial agents*

## 10 Principles for effective use of <br> antibacterial therapy

::: nonincremental
1.  Accurate differential diagnosis

2.  Only use antibiotics when they alter the clinical course

3.  Empirically target microbes in differential diagnosis

4.  A lower threshold for empirical therapy should be used in critically-ill patients

5.  Host factors affect the spectrum of empirical therapy

6.  PK/PD principles impact optimal treatment

7.  De-escalate antibiotic therapy based on microbiology results and clinical (biomarker) responses

8.  If therapy is not working, consider source control or alternative diagnosis before broadening therapy

9.  Distiniguish new infection from failure of initial therapy

10. The duration of therapy should be as short as possible based on available evidence (shorter is better)
:::

## Principle #1: Accurate differential diagnosis

<br>

### What is the most tool for deciding to start antibiotic therapy?

A. Patient medical history

B. Physicial Exam

C. Radiological imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT or MRI)

D. Microbiological tests (e.g., culture, PCR, serology)

## Antibiotics are usually started empirically

<br>

### Antibiotics should only be started if the differential diagnosis includes likely invasive bacterial infections: 90-98% of upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses

Clinicianss frequently *overestimate* the risk of bacterial infection

## Clinicians frequently *underestimate* the risks of antibiotic therapy

<br>

<br>

::: callout-warning
## 1 in 5 patients given antibiotic prescriptions are harmed by them because of adverse events or superinfections by resistant pathogens or *Clostridioides difficile*
:::

<br>

::: callout-warning
## Every additional 10 days of antibiotic therapy confers a 3% increased risk of an ADE
:::

<br>

The combination of fear from uncertainty of the diagnosis and lack of appreciation of how dangerous antibiotics can be is a particularly important driver of inappropriate prescriptions for upper respiratory tract illnesses in outpatient settings

## Mistaking positive cultures as evidence of infection

<br> The presence of a positive culture in the absence of signs or symptoms of infection should not reflexively trigger antibiotic prescription. <br> In many cases, absent signs or symptoms of infection represent *colonization or contamination* and should not trigger treatment.

## Principle #2: Only use antibiotics when they alter clinical course

-   The administration of antibiotics should not be a reflexive response to infection, but rather should be incorporated into an overall, rational therapeutic plan for the patient.

-   Patients who lack bacterial infections cannot have their clinical course improved by antibiotics (as discussed in Principle #1).
